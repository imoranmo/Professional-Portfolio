# Professional-Portfolio

For this weeks assignment we were delegated to create the beginning of a professional portfolio with the requirements below:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

I was able to create the following

![portfolio demo](./assets/images/desktop.png)

I have three sections one for About Me, Work and Contacts

My about me section contains a picture of me and text

My work section contains three work samples with clickable images

My Contact section contains three form of contact email, phone & git hub account link.

Once you resize the website to mobile it does the following

On mobile the image at the header disappear and the text for the header also shrink

All images and sections all appear in a row instead of grouped liked they were on a regular desktop.
